# JavaScript Smackdown: Choosing Between Angular, Ember, and Backbone.

## Presented

- [Fluent Conf 2014](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014/public/schedule/detail/31870)
- [OpenWest 2014](http://www.openwest.org/)

## Layout

There are four folders: one for each framework as well as the presentation. Each folder is self-contained and has all the necessary components to run each part.

## Development

Please feel free to look over the repos. I'll be developing them bit by bit as I present it multiple times. If you see errors, feel free to fork-and-fix or leave an issue.

## License

This repo contains multiple libraries and images that each have their own license. For what code I've written it's all open sourced under the MIT license.
